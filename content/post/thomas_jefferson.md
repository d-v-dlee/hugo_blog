Examining why Thomas Jefferson was Great as well as his shortcomings through Jon Meacham's *Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power*.

<!--more-->
### Exploring Thomas Jefferson

We all "know" Thomas Jefferson. He was a Founding Father and the author of the Declaration of Independence. He was the 3rd President of the United States and responsible for the Louisiana Purchase and Lewis and Clark's famous expedition out West. He's on the $2 bill and nickel.

But what made him Great? What experiences shaped him to accomplish the amazing feats he did? What were his failures?

By diving into these questions, we can better understand Thomas Jefferson and American history as well learn lessons in how we can better conduct ourselves.

### Early Life

Thomas Jefferson was born as an English colonist into a wealthy plantation-owning family in Virginia. His father Peter Jefferson was a well-respected, prosperous business man. In addition to upper-class Virginian values, Peter Jefferson instilled into his son an emphasis on a physically vigorous lifestlye and top-notch education. Young Thomas lionized his father and took these lessons to heart. 

His mother Jane Jefferson was an astute, detail-oriented woman, equally adept at hosting and entertaining guests and running the Jefferson estates. Afer Peter Jefferson's early death, Jane Jefferson managed the Jefferson affairs (2,750 acres, 66 slaves, hired workers) solo, all while raising 8 kids. Thomas Jefferson deeply respected his mother and when reflecting on her resilience, noted:

>"The most fortunate of us all in our journey through life frequently meet with calamities and misfortunes that will greatly afflict us. And to fortify our minds against the attacks of these calamities and misfortunes should be one of the principle studies and endeavors of our lives."

Jefferson faced plenty of adversity throughout his life, from the deaths of his children and wife, to the attack on his home and honor by Red Coats. Thanks to his mother, he had a direct example of how to ride out of the storms of life.

In addition to his parents, Jefferson received mentorship from his elders and modeled his behavior after them, so he could "match or surpass them in high-standing."

>"Under temptations and difficulties, I would ask myself, what would Dr Small, Mr. Wiyth, or Peyton Randolph do in this situation? What course in it will insure me their approbation?"


### Education

Thomas Jefferson valued education over everything. He stated that given the choice, he would choose the classical education his father arranged for him over the estates his father left.

He was very disciplined about his studies. In law school, Thomas Jefferson studied for 13-15 hours a day keeping the following schedule: 

- **Mornings - Noon**: Study law.
- **Noon - Afternoon (2 hours)**: Vigorous exercise and riding no matter the weather. Worse weather builds more resilience towards illness. He carried this habit until he died.
- **Afternoon - Bedtime**: Split rest of the day between history, philosophy and poetry.

He never stopped learning, exploring whatever piqued his curiousity. He became a learned man in many subjects. In Europe's sophisticated courts, he was known as a fascinating individual, deeply knowledgable about art, architecture, history, philosophy and the sciences. Even as President, he carved out time in the evenings to conduct activities like examining animal pelts sent by Lewis and Clark and conducting botanical experiments to attempt to produce superior crops.

Like his father, Jefferson emphasized the importance of study to his children.

>"Time spent on study was never wasted. **Knowledge is indeed a desirable, lovely possession.**"

His love for learning also spilled into his political career. Jefferson was one of the first who aimed to improve public education to provide better opportunities for all Americans.

Post-political career, he helped establish the University of Virginia.

### Tools of Power

Thomas Jefferson relied on three main tools to amass and wield power.

1. Writing 
2. Conversation 
3. Civility 

#### Writing

Thomas Jefferson used writing to 1) shape debate and 2) capture people's hearts and minds.

To Jefferson, being a statesman was to use the "power of language to project a vision of what might be and to inspire people to share that vision." In addition, writing was to be used to "exert one's will in the legislative and convince other politicians to enlist in a cause."

Through his writing, he could first focus public attention to matters he cared about. Once the topic of discussion was framed appropriately, he would appeal to both people's emotions and rationality. In his writing, he aimed to "distill complexity into a comprehensible message" while borrowing from themes and ideas from human nature and religion. Essentially, he tried to create memes through writing.

His famous words in the Declaration of Independence clearly illustrate his ability to transmit a powerful idea:

>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

{{< figure src="/images/jefferson/DoI.jpg">}}


#### Conversation

Thomas Jefferson's greatest strength was his interpersonal skills. As a young man, Jefferson observed the importance of keeping engaging company, to both gain information and build relationships. Throughout his career, he built power through his unrivaled ability of listening, conversing and making other people feel special.

Jefferson was a fantastic listener, "immersing himself in the subtle skills of engaging others, chiefly by **offering people what they value most: an attentive audience to listen to their own visions and views.**"

He also was a great conversationalist. No matter who he spoke to, Jefferson always turned the subject to ones to who he was conversing with was most familiar with. This not only allowed the speaker to feel important, but also exposed Jefferson to things and ideas he was less familiar with.

Jefferson used dinners to emphasize his power of listening and conversing. Political foes who might slander him in the papers would arrive in his home, feel distinguished by Jefferson's attention, and leave as Stans.

In his own words:

>"Politicans talk too much and listen too little, which can be self-defeating. For in many instances, the surer root to winning is not to convince them that you are right, but that you care about what they think. **Everyone wants to believe what they have to say is fascinating, illuminating, possibly even epochal.** The best political figures created the impression they find that everyone they encounter to be one **of the choice ones of the earth.**

People loved talking to Thomas Jefferson as he made them feel important and heard. In return he gained their loyalty.


#### Civility

Thomas Jefferson was always cordial and made it a point to never argue or contradict someone in public. He saw conflict as antithetical to creating harmonious solutions as the more prideful someone felt, the less rational they'd be. Civilty in his words, was **"most required when least convenient."**

Instead of quarreling, he would find out exactly what his opponent wanted, bake it into the solution of what he wanted, and then politely present the compromise as if it was their idea.

Using this method, he almost always got his way, "quitely but unmistakenly, without bluster or bombaste, his words congenial, but his will unwavering."


### Political Traits

At a meta level, Thomas Jefferson was guided by two principles: 1) to only fight battles you could win and 2) never trade real progress, no matter how compromised, for the dreams of the ideal.

An unfortunate example of principle one is Thomas Jefferson's approach on slavery. After failing to gain traction in the condemnation of slavery as a young lawyer, he pretty much gave up fighting against slavery the rest of his career.

An example of principle two is illustrated by the views of his constituents at the end of his presidency. When Thomas Jefferson took office, the Federalists abhorred him while the Republicans adored him. By the time he was leaving office, some Republicans complained he was "not Republican enough." His displeasing of the two extremes (hardcore Federalists and Republicans) illustrates that he was a man guided by principled pragmatism and not dogma. He served the American people, not a particular party.

At a policy level, Thomas Jefferson's core hedgehog belief was the idea that the great struggle of the age was **"Republicanism vs. Absolutism."** All of his actions were guided by this core belief. Even after the defeat of the British in the Revolutionary War, Jefferson was constantly wary of the ever-lurking presence of the British and the Americans (Alexander Hamilton) still receptive to ideas aligned with Absolutism.

Strategically, he looked like a hypocrite, opposing a strong central government while George Washington's Secretary of State while all for it as President. While his actions objectively look flip-floppy, when viewed through the lens of his hedgehog belief, we see that he did anything required to protect the young Republic from threats real and perceived.

A funny (?) sidenote is that Thomas Jefferson was the original Middle East meddler. As President, he wanted to overthrow the ruler of Tripoli (modern day Lebanon) and replace him with his easier-to-handle brother. 

### Slavery

Thomas Jefferson's legacy is most complicated when it comes to slavery.

On one hand, he thought slavery was morally wrong and tried to fight it early on in his career. On the other hand, he was born into a slave-owning family and benefitted greatly from it. Ultimately, while he thought slavery was wrong, he opposed simple plans to eradicate it for fears that its negative impact on the US would outweigh the delivered moral justice.

Jefferson benefitted greatly from slavery. Jefferson's plantation was a huge and tidy operation, self-sufficient from any outside help. Like his parents, he had an easy sense of command and a great eye for detail. At Monticello, he controlled a manufacturing pipeline of skilled adult laborers, such as carpenters, masons, brick layers, and smiths, as well as child workers. Boy slaves produced 10,000 nails a day!!

Jefferson saw slavery as a moral stain, yet he could not envision any scenario where the eradication of slavery could succeed. Given the treatment of slaves, Jefferson, like many other whites, feared that freedom could lead to violent revenge. Therefore, he could not imagine a society of both free whites and blacks. If slavery was to be abolished, the blacks would have to leave.

Outside of personal safety, Jefferson also believed that the eradication of slavery would open the United States to greater threats from Absolutism (remember his Hedgehog idea). The fate of the United States as a republic relied on its unity. Upsetting the South and fractioning itself would leave it more susceptible to British influence or even invasion. This was unacceptable.

During the debates over slavery in Missouri, Jefferson had a chance to condemn slavery. Instead, he folded to pro-slavery views, remarking personally, that while he'd love to end the abominable act, slavery was a problem he could not solve.

Despite his personal words and beliefs on slavery, Thomas Jefferson wasn't about that action. 

### Sally Hemmings

Sally Hemmings is where things gets juicy and fucked up!

Sally Hemmings, a slave, was the half-sister of Jefferson's dead wife. She was 10 years old when Martha Jefferson died and accompanied Thomas Jefferson to France when she was 14. She became Jefferson's mistress in France.

While they were in Paris, France abolished slavery. Sally Hemmings alerted Jefferson of her decision to stay in Paris as a free woman but Jefferson begged her to return to the US, promising he would free *their* children once they turned 19.

Their relationship was an open-secret yet Jefferson never openly acknowledged its existence. When political rivals tried to slander Jefferson's name by pointing to Sally and his mixed children, Jefferson let the rumors die by never even addressing them.

Jefferson followed through on his promise and did free *his children.* His children and their descendants ended up living the rest of their lives as *free whites*.

While we can understand his overall views on slavery given the time period, how was Jefferson, the great thinking man, able to rationalize enslaving his own children??? 

Even through the lens of the late 18th and early 19th century, this seems like a black stain on Jefferson's legacy.

Sidenote: His white side of the family loved and adored him dearly. He was a gentle and beloved Patriarch. Which illustrates how fucked up slavery was.

### Religion

One area where Thomas Jefferson is probably underappreciated is in his impact on religion in the United States, particularly in respect to separation of Church and State.

On a personal level, Thomas Jefferson identified as a Christian. Ever the rational man, he believed in the teachings of Jesus but rejected Jesus' divinity. He simplified his beliefs to three simple ideas:

1. There is only One god and he is all perfect
2. There is a future state of rewards and punishments
3. To love God with all thy heart and thy neighbor as themself is the sum of religion

Jefferson was also very progressive in his beliefs, appreciating all religions and believe that faith was ultimately a relationship between an individual and his God.

>"If I were to be a founder of a new sect, I would call them Epicurians. And after the example of the bee, advise them to extract the honey from every sect. My fundamental principle would be that **we are to be saved by our good works within our power, and not by our faith, which is not within our power."**

>"My faith is known to my God and my God alone."

Clearly, he saw the benefit of religion but did not want to encroach on others beliefs with the fist of government.

At a societal level, he recognized religion as an important fabric of society, but preached rational thought and warned against zealots. In his eyes, the greatest threat to the teachings of Jesus were those who exposited it the loudest and perverted it to their own benefit (hello Trump evangelicals). What was more important than specific faith (empty words) was good actions.

For this view, Jefferson was viewed something like the anti-Christ by those who wanted to explicitly tie Christianity into everyday life via laws. Yet he held fast to the idea of separation of Church and State. 

Benjamin Rush summed up their views in a snippet from a letter:

>"I agree with you likewise to keep religion and government independent. Were it possible for St. Paul to rise from his grave at the present juncture, he would say to the clergy who are so active in settling the political affairs  of the world, "Cease from your political labors, your Kingdom is not of this world. Read my epistles. In no part of them do you see me aiming to depose a pagan emperor or place a Christian upon a throne. Christianity disdains from receiving support from human governments."

In summation, Jefferson found religion important and valuable to individuals but rejected imposing it from a government level. He was open-minded to all religions and focused on good works over faith. Without Jefferson, it is likely we would not experience the same Freedom of Religion we experience today.

However, we must still guard our liberties, as just like in Jefferson's time, we still suffer from those trying to tie religious aspects explictly into government and those who loudly preach *their Christianity* to the world.

### 10 Bits of Wisdom

Lastly, here are 10 maxims he wrote towards the end-of-his-life.

1. Never put off what you can do today.
2. Never trouble another for what you can do yourself.
3. Never spend your money before you have it.
4. Never buy what you do not want because it is cheap. it will be dear to you.
5. Pride costs more than hunger, thirst and cold.
6. We never repent of eating too little.
7. Nothing is troublesome that we do willingly.
8. How much has it costs us, the evils that has never happened.
9. Take things always by theier smooth handle.
10. When angry, count 10 before you speak. If very angry, 100.

### Conclusion

#### What made him Great?

Thomas Jefferson was Great for several reasons. 

The first was his habits. He loved learning and built time in his schedule to do so. His voracious reading and writing transformed him into a masterful writer that helped him win the hearts and minds of his constituents and fellow statesmen. He also understood the link between a healthy body and mind and made it a point to exercise at least two hours, mainly through riding, every day. This kept him fresh and productive.

The second reason Thomas Jefferson was Great was due to his interpersonal skills. If there is anything we can emulate, it is this. So what can we do?

- Listen carefully. Make others not only feel heard, but also important, as if what they're saying truly is ground-breaking.
- Focus the conversation so the other speaker is the star. Speak about topics that they're an expert on.
- Don't argue. Hold your tongue. Make compromises.

This sounds annoying but imagine all of the boring conversations Jefferson had to endure. Yet almost every account by anyone who spoke to him raved about how much they loved Thomas Jefferson. 

Jefferson also had to endure attacks on his character and ideas. His method for dealing with this was 1) to not even acknowledge it (don't answer that Twitter troll!) or 2) killing them with kindness and therefore winning them over. By controlling his emotions, he could focus the topic of discussion and his energy on issues he could control and win.

#### What Shaped Him

Clearly his parents had a large influence on him but Thomas Jefferson also relied on the wisdom of those he admired. Similarly, we can first identify people we admire and then imagine what would they do in difficult situations.

If we feel like we don't have the wisdom to make right decision, at least we can have the wisdom to borrow wisdom from those that do. 

#### His Failures

While I can understand given the time period, that Thomas Jefferson's personal interests ultimately outweighed his feelings against slavery, his behavior with Sally Hemmings is pretty twisted.

No one is perfect and this is probably the one black mark on Jefferson's legacy. Despite all of this, Jefferson was instrumental to the birth of the United States, its continued freedom from England, and the Separation of Church and State. Thomas Jefferson is an American hero that we should all be thankful for.
