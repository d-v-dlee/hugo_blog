TLDR: Sleep is really important. The Oura Ring helps you track sleep (+ activity and meditation). Being able to improve sleep off the data is hard. The Oura ring is a cool product - not life-changing but definitely cool.

### The NBA

Hype and awareness for the Oura ring is growing due to the NBA rumor that all players will be mandated to wear one for preventative Covid-19 tracking. While I am little skeptical of its efficacy there, from my past experience I've seen spikes in body temperature and heart rate a few days before feeling sick.

Its also funny that the Oura ring will now be adopted primarily for Covid instead of sleep. The article below highlights the NBA's recognition of sleep as a competitive advantage so I'm surprised it wasn't adopted sooner. Since I do not have Oura's data to back up their Covid claims, I will simply stick with sharing my experience with their product.

### Sleep

Before we dive into the Oura ring, let's just recap why we'd even want to track sleep. At a high-level, sleep is important because its involved in wide range of bodily functions including: hormone production, metabolism, cellular repair, memory, learning, and muscle growth. Poor sleep is linked to increased chance of obesity, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Sleep is obviously good.

A few years ago, I had a terrible bout of insomnia that made me feel all of those listed effects first-hand. It was *terrible.* 

That experience is what ultimately got me interested in sleep. I figured if I could first track my sleep, I could then optimize it. The ultimate goal was to fall asleep faster, sleep deeper, and feel more refreshed each morning.

Did Oura help me accomplish this goal...?

### Sleep Data:
Sleep is really weird.

{{< figure src="images/oura/oura_deep_vs_rem.png" title="Deep Sleep vs. Rem ~2 years" >}}

The redline depicts my **REM sleep** while the purple is my **Deep Sleep.** Per Oura, **deep sleep** is the most restorative and rejuvenating sleep stage, enabling muscle growth and repair. On average, it makes up 0-20% of your total sleep time (1 - 1.5 hours). On the otherhand, REM (rapid eye movement) is associated with dreaming, memory consolidation, learning and creativity. On average, REM accounts for 20-25% of your total sleep time (1.5 - 2 hours).

Ideally, we'd have a high amount of both, deep sleep for gains, bro and REM for learning. But as you can see, my REM sleep has taken somewhat of a nose-dive while my Deep Sleep has been increasing.

While I think my Deep Sleep is increasing because of 1) exercising more and 2) the use of Chili Pad, I can't be certain that is not just noise. I really have no explanation for the decrease in REM sleep.

### Behavior, Environment and Goals

Overall, I sleep pretty well. However, things I would like to improve are: 
1. Maximize ratio of sleep/time spent in bed.
    - If I went to bed at 10 pm and woke up at 6 am, I'd expect 8 hours of sleep. In reality, I' probably getting 6.5 - 7 hours. 6.5 / 8 = 81%.
2. Increase average sleeping time.
3. Maximize Deep/REM sleep.

To do so:

I need to help my body associate my bed with only sleep. While I do mostly use my bed for reading and sleeping, I also do like to occasionally watch TV from my room. We'll be moving the TV out to the living room shortly so we'll see how much that has played a role in my sleep/time spent in bed ratio and my ability to quickly fall and stay asleep.

Make my room darker. I rarely can even sleep 8+ hours. Part of the problem is that my room is exposed to outside light. While this is somewhat good - I'm in sync with the sun, I wouldn't mind getting another hour or so.

I don't know. Avoid blue light earlier and keep using my Chili pad?

### Other Cool Features

- Cool UX

- Good Battery Life
    - One full charge lasts your 3-5 days.
- Integration with Activity/Meditation
    - Oura is easily integrated with meditation apps like Oak. Here you can see meditation "working" as my HR decreases and HRV increases (more relaxed).

### Closing Thoughts

- The Oura ring is durable - it has served me well for almost 2 years now. 
- It provides cool data on sleep, activity, and meditation.
- Acting on the data is kind of difficult due to the strangeness of sleep.
- The Oura ring costs $299. Was it worth it? For me, yes. But it is certainly not life-changing.
